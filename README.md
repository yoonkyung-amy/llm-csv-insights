# LLM CSV Insights

This is a tool that lets you ask questions about CSV files in natural language.  
It combines fast rule-based analytics with an optional LLM fallback **(TinyLLaMA)** for open-ended reasoning.

---

## Features
- Upload any CSV and query it in plain English
- Rule-based engine for precise queries (examples: average, max, min, distinct)
- Fallback to an open-source LLM (TinyLLaMA) for more complex reasoning
- Streamlit UI for interactive demo
- Automatic checks (style + tests run on GitHub)
- Easy to run anywhere with Docker
